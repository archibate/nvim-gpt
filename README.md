# nvim-gpt

Integrated **ChatGPT** and **Bing AI** in NeoVim just for neo-pioneers like you :)

## Usage

In normal mode:

- Press `<CR>` or `:GPT <question>` to enter GPT prompt, input your question, and you get the answer in the pop-up GPT window on the right.
- Press `g<CR>` or `:GPTWrite <question>` to enter GPT prompt, input your requiement description for code (e.g. write a quick sort). The current filetype will be automatically appended for you (e.g. write a quick sort, in cpp), and you get the code in the pop-up GPT window. And after GPT completes their answer you may press 'a' to insert the code directly to where you pressed `g<CR>`.

In visual mode:

- Press `<CR>` or `:GPTCode <question>` to enter GPT prompt, input the question you want to ask or action you want to do on the code. The code will be appended to the question, and you will get the output code from GPT in the pop-up GPT window.

Utilize the cool vim range expressions:

- Try `:%GPTCode` for sending the whole file to GPT.
- Try `:.GPTCode` for sending only the current line to GPT.
- Try `:1,.GPTCode` for sending from first line to current line to GPT.
- Try `:.,$GPTCode` for sending from current line to last line to GPT.
- Try `:-5,+4GPTCode` for sending from the previous 5 lines and the next 4 lines to GPT.
- Try `:'<,'>GPTCode` for sending the selected (visual mode) lines to GPT.

In the GPT prompt:

- You may type 'How to fix this error?' to describe the task for GPT.
- But we've already got some nice templates for you, to use the template named 'fix' for example, simply type: `@f` or `@fix`, it will be automatically replaced by `How to fix this error?`
- There is also a useful template called `@q` or `@quote` which is equivalent to `Please wrap the final answer with triple quotes`, which not only gives us a better syntax highlighting for code, but also make it easier to seperate the real answer from GPT's descriptive text like `Sure` or `Here is the result:`, see below.
- See [keymaps.py](rplugin/python3/py_nvim_gpt/keymaps.py) for a complete list of all templates provided by default, you may override the templates in the setup option `question_templates = ...`, see bottom.
- If you want to edit multi-line questions, simply press `<Esc>` then `i` to enter insert mode again. Now pressing `<CR>` in insert mode won't trigger submit anymore, and you may use `<CR>` or `o` in normal mode to compose multi-line questions. After finished editing the question, press `<CR>` in normal mode to submit. The question buffer is remained when you use `r` to regenerate answer from GPT.

In the GPT window:

- Suppose you just got the code generated by GPT in the GPT window, now press `a` to accept their change, and apply it to your previous visual selected code lines (simply replace it).
- Pressing `a` will only paste the code into your file, excluding the descriptive texts, when a triple-quoted \`\`\` code block is found.
- If you dislike the current answer, you may press `r` to re-edit the question (if needed), then press `<CR>` again let GPT to regenerate a different solution.
- Press `d` to delete all memory of this GPT session, i.e. reset.
- Press `s` to stop GPT from generating the complete answer.
- Press `q` or `<Esc>` to close the GPT window and back to where you're editing.
- Press `i` to follow up with a new question (equivalent to `:GPT`).

## Multi-backend support

You may use `:GPTModel <model_name>` to switch to another model, e.g. `:GPTModel creative` to switch to the Bing AI - 'creative'. The default model is 'gpt-3.5-turbo', which can be tweaked in setup options, see below.

If you have [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim), use `:Telescope gpt_models` to show a list of all GPT models to select from.

## Install

It's suggested to use [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) to manage NeoVim plugins, this plugin for example:

```lua
use({
    'archibate/nvim-gpt',
    -- optional for supporting ':Telescope gpt_models' and ':Telescope gpt_inputs' commands (TBD)
    requires = { 'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim' },
    config = function()
        require'nvim-gpt'.setup {
            model = 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
            window_width = 45,
            -- see more setup options in section 'Setup options' below
        }
    end,
})
```

After adding above code to `init.lua`, restart nvim and run `:PackerInstall` and `:PackerCompile`.

Then try run `:GPTOpen` command and if everything working fine the GPT window should shows up.

> If not, try `:UpdateRemotePlugins`.

### For ChatGPT users

[openai-python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) is required for using the ChatGPT backend.

```bash
pip install openai
```

1. Obtain an API key from OpenAI: https://beta.openai.com

2. Add this to your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-**********  # replace this with your API key
```

3. and then restart your shell, enter nvim and choose `gpt-3.5-turbo` as model, which is default.

### For Bing AI users

[EdgeGPT](https://github.com/acheong08/EdgeGPT) is required for using the Bing AI backend.

```bash
pip install EdgeGPT
```

1. Obtain the cookies JSON via [Cookie Editor](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/cookieeditor/neaplmfkghagebokkhpjpoebhdledlfi) plugin from the [Bing site](https://bing.com/chat).

2. Paste the cookies into file `~/.bing-cookies.json`.

3. Enter nvim and `:GPTModel balanced`. For setting Bing AI as default, add `model = 'balanced'` to setup options.

### For Google users

[googlesearch-python](https://pypi.org/project/googlesearch-python) is required for using the Google search backend.

```bash
pip install googlesearch-python
```

Then enter nvim and `:GPTModel googlesearch-python`. Now search current word with `gy<CR>`, current line with `gs<CR>`.

## Keymaps

There are keymaps applied **by default** when loading this plugin. See [keymaps.py](rplugin/python3/py_nvim_gpt/keymaps.py):

```vim
" <CR> input, g<CR> line, gs<CR> word, gu<CR> file
nnoremap <CR> :GPT<Space>
vnoremap <CR> :GPTCode<Space>
nnoremap g<CR> :GPTWrite<Space>
nnoremap <silent> gs<CR> <Cmd>exec ":GPT " . getline('.')<CR>
nnoremap <silent> gy<CR> <Cmd>exec ":GPT " . expand('<cword>')<CR>
nnoremap <silent> gu<CR> <Cmd>%GPTCode<CR>
```

Can be disabled by `no_default_keymaps = true` option in setup.

### GPT window keymaps

Apart from universal keymaps above, inside the GPT window, which is not modifiable, also have their own keymaps:

```vim
" (i)nput (a)ccept (r)egenerate (d)iscard e(x)ecute (s)top (q)uit
nnoremap <buffer><silent> i <Cmd>GPT<CR>
nnoremap <buffer><silent> a <Cmd>GPTAccept<CR>
nnoremap <buffer><silent> A <Cmd>GPTAccept!<CR>
nnoremap <buffer><silent> r <Cmd>GPTRegenerate!<CR>
nnoremap <buffer><silent> dd <Cmd>GPTDiscard<CR>
nnoremap <buffer><silent> x <Cmd>GPTExecute<CR>
nnoremap <buffer><silent> s <Cmd>GPTStop<CR>
nnoremap <buffer><silent> q <Cmd>wincmd q<CR>
nnoremap <buffer><silent> <Esc> <Cmd>wincmd q<CR>
```

### GPT multiline edit keymaps

```vim
nnoremap <buffer><silent> <CR> <Cmd>GPTMultiline<CR>
inoremap <expr><buffer><silent> <CR> (!exists('b:_no_enter_submit') ? '<Esc><Cmd>GPTMultiline<CR>' : '<CR>')
snoremap <expr><buffer><silent> <CR> (!exists('b:_no_enter_submit') ? '<Esc><Cmd>GPTMultiline<CR>' : '<CR>')
inoremap <buffer><silent> <Esc> <Esc><Cmd>let b:_no_enter_submit = 1<CR>
snoremap <buffer><silent> <Esc> <Esc><Cmd>let b:_no_enter_submit = 1<CR>
nnoremap <buffer><silent> q <Cmd>wincmd q<CR>
nnoremap <buffer><silent> <Esc> <Cmd>wincmd q<CR>
autocmd BufLeave <buffer={bufnr}> exec bufwinnr({bufnr}) == -1 ? "" : bufwinnr({bufnr}) . "wincmd q"
```
